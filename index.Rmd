I am a Research Scientist at Amazon. 

My methodological expertise is in impact evaluations, experimental and quasi-experimental methods, survey design, and data visualizations. My research areas cover topics in skill development, public policy, and international development. 

I hold a Ph.D. from Harvard University, where I was a [NAEd/Spencer Dissertation Fellow](https://naeducation.org/2021-naed-spencer-dissertation-fellows/) and a Ph.D. Scholar in the [Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/people/nozomi-nakajima) at the Harvard Kennedy School.
