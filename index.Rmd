I am a Ph.D. student in Education Policy & Program Evaluation at Harvard University.

My research examines how education policy interacts with family life to reduce and maintain inequality.

I am also a Ph.D. scholar in the [Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/) and a graduate student affiliate at the [Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/nozomi-nakajima). My research is supported by the [Weatherhead Initiative on Gender Inequality](https://wigi.wcfia.harvard.edu/).

My CV is available [here](files/Nakajima_CV_public copy.pdf).
