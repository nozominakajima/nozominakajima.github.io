I am a Ph.D. candidate in Education Policy & Program Evaluation at Harvard University. I am a quantitative social scientist studying how people make educational decisions and the consequences of these decisions on economic and social inequality. My current research examines: (i) how policymakers make evidence-based decisions in education and (ii) how low-income households invest in their childrenâ€™s education. My research leverages large-scale administrative records and surveys collected in partnership with government and non-profit organizations. Through these collaborations, my work aims to improve the use of research evidence in education.

I am a [NAEd/Spencer Dissertaion Fellow](https://naeducation.org/2021-naed-spencer-dissertation-fellows/) and a Ph.D. Scholar in the [Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality & Social Policy](https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu/people/nozomi-nakajima) at the Harvard Kennedy School.

**I am on the job market.** My CV is available [here](files/nakajima_cv copy.pdf).
